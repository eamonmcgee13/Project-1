<br>I would say I'm sorry
<br>If I thought that it would change your mind
<br>But I know that this time
<br>I have said too much
<br>Been too unkind
<br>I tried to laugh about it
<br>Cover it all up with lies
<br>I tried to laugh about it
<br>Hiding the tears in my eyes
<br>'Cause boys don't cry
<br>Boys don't cry
<br>I would break down at your feet
<br>And beg forgiveness, plead with you
<br>But I know that it's too late
<br>And now there's nothing I can do
<br>So I try to laugh about it
<br>Cover it all up with lies
<br>I try to laugh about it
<br>Hiding the tears in my eyes
<br>'Cause boys don't cry
<br>Boys don't cry
<br>I would tell you that I loved you
<br>If I thought that you would stay
<br>But I know that it's no use
<br>And you've already gone away
<br>Misjudged your limits
<br>Pushed you too far
<br>Took you for granted
<br>Thought that you needed me more, more, more
<br>To get you back by my side
<br>But I just keep on laughing
<br>Hiding the tears in my eyes
<br>'Cause boys don't cry
<br>Boys don't cry
<br>Boys don't cry
